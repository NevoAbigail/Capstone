This document will outline the verification and validation plans we have created for the purpose of proving that the SmartLock device is a successful product. The tests mentioned in this document will validate our product against the various requirements which we have outlined in the SRS document. At the completion of the plan in this document, we will have the knowledge required to form an iterative design process which improves into a successful device at its completion. 

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}
\-\
The smart lock can be broken down into two main components, the software (ie. the smartphone application) and the hardware (ie. the physical lock).

The smartphone application, SmartLock, will be a basic UI that our users can interact with to send a signal to unlock/lock the locking mechanism, check in on the battery of the device, and remember where they left their bike when they locked it.

The physical locking device will be used to secure the wheels to the bike frame, which can also be connected to an external mount.

These components will be tested through various different methods, to determine if they meet all the requirements outlined in the \href{https://github.com/NevoAbigail/Capstone/blob/main/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS}.

\subsection{Objectives}
\-\
The objective that our project hopes to accomplish is to create a simple-to-use smartphone app that allows users to lock the most important features of their bike with confidence and to allow them to find their bike with ease.

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}
\-\
For more information on the project breakdown, planning or delivery refer to the following documentation:

\section{Plan}
\-\
In this section, various aspects of the verification plan will be illustrated explaining the process from concept to implementation. Beginning with an outline of the Validation team and their roles in guiding the process, this section will cover the verification of our SRS documentation as well as how we plan to design, implement and test our problem and eventually prototype our solution. It also covers any automation tools used as well as a software validation plan.

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}
\-\
Our plan for verification of the SRS includes the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Keep the Document Alive
\subitem By keeping the document alive we will be able to continually update any requirements/constraints/objectives that adapt as our project comes to life.  This will ensure that all the documentation is accurate. 
\item Peer Review
\subitem We will use the peer review to verify our work and to look for inconsistencies or aspects that we didn't consider.
\item TA Review
\subitem The TA review will be used to validate what we have done and what needs to be reworked as the project progresses.
\item SRS Checklist
\subitem With every update of the SRS document and progression of the SmartLock we will continue to reference the  \href{https://github.com/NevoAbigail/Capstone/blob/main/docs/Checklists/SRS-Checklist.pdf}{SRS Checklist} to ensure that we continue to meet all the requirements and produce complete documentation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}
\-\
Our plan for verification of the Design Plan includes the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Review with Supervisor (Dr. Sirouspour)
\subitem As a novice design team, we will use the meetings with Dr. Sirouspour to review, primarily the hardware components of, our design and understand if we are using the right technical pieces and if our approach can lead to success. 
\item Proof of Concept Demo
\subitem The proof of concept demo will be a crucial part of our validation plan.  With the intent to be able to demonstrate both a portion of our physical component and a preliminary software UI, the presentation and feedback will provide us with an opportunity to validate our objectives and verify the next steps and problem areas.
\item Testing
\subitem Testing, which will be discussed in detail below, will be used to understand if our requirements can be met given the scope of this project and help us to determine what needs to change for our final product.
\item MIS \& MG Checklists
\subitem The \href{https://github.com/NevoAbigail/Capstone/blob/main/docs/Checklists/MIS-Checklist.pdf}{MIS Checklist} and the
 \href{https://github.com/NevoAbigail/Capstone/blob/main/docs/Checklists/MG-Checklist.pdf}{MG Checklist} will be used to review the tests that are created and check that they follow the guidelines so that we can properly test the work product. Tests will be reviewed and updated as the project progresses.
\end{enumerate}

\-\

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

Our plan to verify the implementation is outlined below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Functional Requirements Verification

\subitem The verification of our functional requirements will be done by performing the system tests discussed in \nameref{Section 5.1}. The success rate of these system tests will help the team to confirm and validate these requirements and therefore will provide the team with good metrics on the core functionality of the product.

~\newpage

\item Non-Functional Requirements Verification

\subitem The verification of our non-functional requirements will be done by performing the system tests discussed in \nameref{Section 5.2}. The success rate of these system tests will help the team to confirm and validate these requirements and therefore will provide the team with good metrics on the overall quality and class of the product. This will help us in verifying other aspects of the product including the App features, durability and ease of use.

\item Code Implementation Verification

\subitem In order to verify the implementation of our code-base, we will make use of both code walk-throughs and inspection by fellow peers as well as by performing unit tests on our system. Having a peer review done would not only illuminate any shortcomings in our implementation but also help us in identifying more efficient techniques within our code-base. By performing unit tests, which are discussed in \nameref{Section 6}, we can verify different modules within our system to see if each is performing as expected and is robust. This will help us maintain best practices while implementing our code-base.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}
The tools used for automated testing and verifying coding standards are outlined below:

\begin{enumerate}

\item SwiftLint

\subitem SwiftLint will be used in order to enforce common Swift style and naming conventions.

\item CodeFactor

\subitem CodeFactor will be used for automated code analysis on our repo on Github.

\item Github

\subitem Github will be used to host our codebase including all staging branches and the production branch. All changes will need to be approved and reviewed before merging to production.

\item Git

\subitem Git will be used for version control, resolving merge conflicts and interfacing with different branches.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.

Abi: In order to perform verification, specifically on accuracy, we need to be able to have an expected output to compare our real output to. This is especially applicable for battery life. We need to first be able to calculate an expected battery life to then validate it, which is a skill we will need to acquire. 

Stephen: We will need critical thinking skills to approach our device in such a way that we can complete a set of tests which have been created critically and will prove our products design and implementation. We will need technical knowledge on how our device works such that these validation tests will be a complete set.

Elsa: The Team must build our collective knowledge in the area of structural analysis of engineering designs. In order to be able to effectively evaluate our designs for efficacy, robustness, longevity and usefulness, the Team will need to acquire or re-aquire engineering skills related to how to assess the structural integrity of mechanical devices.

Steffi: A skill we will need to acquire to successfully complete the verification and validation of the project is to be able to be accepting of critique and critical in our choices during the design process.  In order to truly be successful we will need to adapt to the information provided to us and not believe that there is only one way to perform our task otherwise we might overlook the best solution.

  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?

Abi: One approach to learn this skill would be doing research on the internet, and another might be to ask for the help of an expert. We are not familiar with someone knowledgeable on this topic, and therefore we will be learning how to calculate battery life through internet research. 

Stephen: To acquire critical thinking skills we will need to think outside the box and ask others their thoughts so that we can gain multiple opinions and a different way of thinking. To acquire the technical knowledge about our device, many hours of research as well as talking with industry professionals will be needed.

Elsa: To acquire or re-quire skills related to structure analysis of mechanical designs, the Team can review previous coursework in Materials related to stress and strain. We can also take advantage of McMaster resources for physical testing, including online databases and professors who have experience in the subject. 

Steffi: One approach to this is to look at how other designs have adapted dramatically to feedback and look out for ideas that might influence our design similarly.  The method that I believe we will use is to fully discuss the implications of any design changes and how they will play out so we can make educated decisions on how to move forward.
