This document will outline the verification and validation plans we have created for the purpose of proving that the Smart Bike Lock device is a successful product. The tests mentioned in this document will validate out product against the various requirements which we have outlined in the SRS document. At the completion of the plan in this document, we will have the knowledge required to form an iterative design process which improves into a sucessful device at its completion. 

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (MG, MIS, etc).  You can include these even
  before they are written, since by the time the project is done, they will be
  written.}

\citet{SRS}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{You, your classmates and the course instructor.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You shoud do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may just
  be ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may have
  something more rigorous/systematic in mind..}

\wss{Remember you have an SRS checklist}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Remember you have MG and MIS checklists}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static verification of
  the implementation.  Potential techniques include code walkthroughs, code
  inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

Input/Condition: Users Engaging and Disengaging the SmartLock.

Output/Results: Scores from 1-5 will be given from most to least amount of relative force required.

How test will be performed: Users will measure force while locking and unlocking. As a group of 3 people will, remove lock from the transport state, and engage the lock as intended.

Control: Manual.

Initial State: The System is ready to be installed.  

Input/Condition: A group of test users with an average understanding of how to use typical tools. They have access to those typical tools. 

Output/Results: The System is successfully mounted on the bike frame without special tools for each test user.

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{Reference your MIS and explain your overall philosophy for test case
  selection.}  
\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS has
  been completed.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}
