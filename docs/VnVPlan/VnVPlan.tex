This document ... \wss{provide an introductory blurb and roadmap of the
  Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (MG, MIS, etc).  You can include these even
  before they are written, since by the time the project is done, they will be
  written.}

\citet{SRS}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{You, your classmates and the course instructor.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You shoud do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may just
  be ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may have
  something more rigorous/systematic in mind..}

\wss{Remember you have an SRS checklist}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Remember you have MG and MIS checklists}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static verification of
  the implementation.  Potential techniques include code walkthroughs, code
  inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\section{System Test Description}
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}
		
\paragraph{Title for Test}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Control: Manual versus Automatic
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}
					
How test will be performed: 
					
\item{test-id2\\}

Control: Manual versus Automatic
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

How test will be performed: 

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1: Smart Phone}
		
\paragraph{Title for Test:}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1: NFR1: Can be used by people who speak any native language. \\}

Type: Manual

Initial State: Lock is engaged and phone is on with App downloaded and open.

Input/Condition: Non-English-speaking test user has no prior knowledge of how to use the System.

Output/Results: The lock is successfully engaged and the bike is securely locked by test user.

How test will be performed: User attempts to disengage the mechanism through the App, attach bike to external frame and re-engage mechanism.
					
\item{test-id2: NFR2: Can reasonably be used without requiring an instruction manual. \\}

Type: Manual

Initial State: Lock is engaged and phone is on with App downloaded and open.

Input/Condition: A group of test users with no prior knowledge of how to use the System. 

Output/Results: The lock is successfully engaged, and the bike is securely locked by all test users.

How test will be performed: Users are told to disengage the mechanism through the App, attach the bike to an external frame and re-engage the mechanism without any instruction. The time required for full usage per test is measured using a stopwatch and must below ten minutes. Learning period is subsequently calculated and plotted. 

\item{test-id3: 3. NFR3: App storage under 50 megabytes. A small mobile app should not take significant space on the userâ€™s phone.  \\}

Type: Static 

Initial State: App development IDE is open and up to date.

Output/Results: App storage is less than 50 megabytes.

How test will be performed: App storage displayed on the IDE is kept below the upper threshold of 50 megabytes. 

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Usability}

\paragraph{Title for Test:}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1: NFR15: The lock must be easily mounted on the bike frame. It does not require special tools, (i.e., those not found in a typical toolbox, such as power tools), to be installed and does not take more than twnety minutes to install.  \\}

Type: Manual 

Initial State: The System is ready to be installed.  

Input/Condition: A group of test users with an average understanding of how to use typical tools. They have access to those typical tools. 

Output/Results: The System is successfully mounted on the bike frame without special tools for each test user. 

How test will be performed: Each user attempts to install the System, following the procedure outlined in the instructions. This procedure will be developed following the completion of the first stage of prototyping. 

\item{test-id2: NFR16: The lock can be used for many different models of mountain, city, and road bikes.  \\}

Type: Manual 

Initial State: The System is ready to be installed. 

Input/Condition: A group of test users with an average understanding of how to use typical tools. They have access to those typical tools. Three different models of bike are tested; one for each type (mountain, city and road). 

Output/Results:	The System can be mounted on all three bike models successfully by each test user. 

How the test will be performed: Three users attempt to install the System, following the procedure outlined in the instructions.  

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{Reference your MIS and explain your overall philosophy for test case
  selection.}  
\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS has
  been completed.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed: 
					
\item{test-id2\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed: 

\item{...\\}
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}
