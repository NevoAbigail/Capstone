\section{Introduction}
This document aims to outline the hazards that may face the SmartLock.  We are defining a hazard to be anything that puts the efficacy of the SmartLock at risk of failure or places the user in danger.  Throughout this document, the potential hazards will be outlined, and through the use of hazard analysis techniques, we will aim to mitigate these risks. 

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

This project's scope is to create a device that securely locks a bike, where the lock can be disengaged via a smartphone app and doesn’t impede the rider's ability to use the bike, causing a safety issue.  It is crucial to understand both, all the requirements of what the project is supposed to accomplish, but also all the risks that may accompany those requirements – this is the purpose of the hazard analysis.  Furthermore, the analysis will aim to assess the system boundaries, critical assumptions and safety requirements to predict the potential hazards' effects in order to preemptively add precautions.

 Risk & A risk indicates a potential safety concern to the user\\ 
  \hline
 Error & An error indicates a problem with the software that relates to the engagement for the lock\\ 
  \hline
 Conflicts & A conflict indicates that an action is trying to be executed in the wrong state, ie. trying to engage the lock when the mechanism is open\\

\section{System Boundaries and Components}
The system can be broken into the following components and has the following boundaries:
\subsection {Physical Components}
Our physical components are the aspects that will be on the bike itself.
\subsubsection{Locking Mechanism}
The locking mechanism will be the component that ensures the security of the bike.
\subsubsection{Opening/Closing Mechanism}
The opening/closing mechanism is the component that will both attach the bike to an external frame and ensure that the wheels will stay connected to the bike when you leave it.
\subsubsection{Sensors}
The sensors will be used to indicate whether or not the lock is open/closed or engaged/disengaged. 
\subsubsection{Battery}
The battery will be used to turn on the electromagnet which allows for the disengagement of the locking mechanism.  It will also be used to power the Arduino (microcontroller) which will allow the smartphone app to communicate with the bike lock.
\subsection {Software Components}
The software components that we will be using are related to our smartphone app.
\subsubsection {App}
The app component itself will be used to communicate with the physical components, via the Arduino, to give the user information on the status of the lock and battery and to allow the user to disengage the lock. 
\subsubsection {Geotagging Location Services}
The location service component will be used to communicate to the app where the bike was located upon engaging the lock, for the purpose of remembering where your bike was left.
\subsection {Boundaries}
\subsubsection{Bike Size}
The boundary that we need to work with on the physical components is the standard sizes of bikes so that the lock can be mounted properly.
\subsubsection{Standard External Frames}
The other physical boundary that we need to work within is the standard size/location of external frames which provides us with measurements for the open/closing mechanism that we must abide by.
\subsubsection{Current Technology}
The software boundary that we must remain within is the bounds of current technology; this is a very feasible and large boundary to work within as we do not plan to use any complex software.

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}

\item[CA\refstepcounter{canum}\thecanum\label{CA1}:] Assume operator is not tampering or purposefully damaging the product.
\item[CA\refstepcounter{canum}\thecanum\label{CA2}:] Assume weather is typical of Canada (i.e., no natural disasters).
\item[CA\refstepcounter{canum}\thecanum\label{CA3}:] Assume operator's smartphone (including all integrated technologies, like Geotagging) is functioning properly.
\item[CA\refstepcounter{canum}\thecanum\label{CA4}:] Assume Geotagging and Bluetooth signals are receivable and transmittable; operator is in a location that can be properly triangulated (i.e., operator is not underground, etc.). 
\item[CA\refstepcounter{canum}\thecanum\label{CA5}:] Assume operator's bicycle has standard frame and dimensions, and functions properly.
\item[CA\refstepcounter{canum}\thecanum\label{CA6}:] Assume operator's smartphone has power/is charged.

\subsection{Existing Requirements}

The following requirements have already been included in the SRS document, and are restated here for convenience: \\

 \noindent FR9: Lock must only be engaged/disengaged by the intended user(s). \newline 
 FR10: The lock can be mounted to the bike's frame. \newline
 NFR6: The lock must be waterproofed to withstand normal rainfall. \\

\section{Roadmap}
The safety requirements that will be implemented in the scope of Mechatronics Capstone 4TB6 are SR1 and SR2. They are vital to the functionality, safety and security of the SmartLock and are reasonably achievable given the constraints of the course, project and Team. The implementation of SR3 will be postponed until after the course has been completed due to financial, temporal and accessibility reasons.
