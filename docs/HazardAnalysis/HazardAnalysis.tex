\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this document is to outline the hazards that may face the SmartLock.  We are defining a hazard to be anything that puts the efficacy of the SmartLock at risk of failure or places the user in danger. 
Throughout this document, the potential hazards will be outlined, and through the use of hazard analysis techniques, we will aim to mitigate these risks. 

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

The scope of this project is to create a device that securely locks a bike where the lock can be engaged and disengaged via a phone and doesn’t impede the rider causing a safety issue.  It is crucial to understand both all the requirements of what a project is supposed to accomplish, but also all the risks that may accompany those requirements – this is the purpose of the hazard analysis.  Furthermore, the analysis will aim to assess the system boundaries, critical assumptions and the safety requirements in order predict the effects of the potential hazards to preemptively add precautions.

 Term & Definition \\ 
 \hline
 Hazard & An action that puts the efficacy of the SmartLock at risk of failure or places the user in danger\\ 
  \hline
 System Failure & System Failure is when the engagement of the lock malfunctions and the lock is no longer secure\\ 
  \hline
 Risk & A risk indicates a potential safety concern to the user\\ 
  \hline
 Error & An error indicates a problem with the software that relates to the engagement for the lock\\ 
  \hline
 Conflicts & A conflict indicates trying to execute an action while the SmartLock is in the wrong state. Ie. trying to engage the lock when the mechanism is open\\

\section{System Boundaries and Components}
The system can be broken into the following components and has the following boundaries:
\subsection {Physical Components}
Our physical components are the aspects that will be on the bike itself.
\subsubsection{Locking Mechanism}
The locking mechanism will be the component that ensures the security of the bike.
\subsubsection{Closing Mechanism}
The closing mechanism is the component that will both attach the bike to an external frame, as well as make sure that the wheels will stay connected to the bike when you leave it.
\subsubsection{Sensors}
The sensors will be used to indicate whether or not the lock is open/closed or engaged/disengaged. 
\subsubsection{Battery}
The battery will be used for the engagement/disengagement of the locking mechanism.  This is the only feature that it will  be used for which will extend the life of this component.
\subsection {Software Components}
The software components that we will be using are related to our smartphone app.
\subsubsection {App}
The app component itself will be used to communicate with the physical components to give the user information on the status of the lock and allow the user to change the engagement/disengagement status. 
\subsubsection {Location Services}
The location service component will be used to communicate to the app where the bike was located upon engaging the lock.
\subsection {Boundaries}
\subsubsection{Bike Size}
The boundary that we need to work with on the physical components is the standard sizes of bikes so that they can be mounted properly.
\subsubsection{Standard External Frames}
The other physical boundary that we need to work within is the standard size/location of external frames which provides us with measurements for the open/closing mechanism that we must abide by.
\subsubsection{Current Technology}
The software boundary that we must remain within is the bounds of current technology; this is a very feasible and large boundary to work within as we do not plan to use any complex software.

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}

\item[CA\refstepcounter{canum}\thecanum\label{CA1}:] Assume operator is not tampering or purposefully damaging the product.
\item[CA\refstepcounter{canum}\thecanum\label{CA2}:] Assume weather is typical of Canada (i.e., no natural disasters).
\item[CA\refstepcounter{canum}\thecanum\label{CA3}:] Assume operator's smartphone (including all integrated technologies, like GPS) is functioning properly.
\item[CA\refstepcounter{canum}\thecanum\label{CA4}:] Assume GPS and Bluetooth signals are receivable and transmittable; operator is in a location that can be properly triangulated (i.e., operator is not underground, etc.). 
\item[CA\refstepcounter{canum}\thecanum\label{CA5}:] Assume operator's bicycle has standard frame and dimensions, and functions properly.
\item[CA\refstepcounter{canum}\thecanum\label{CA6}:] Assume operator's smartphone has power/is charged. 

\end{itemize}


\section{Failure Modes and Effects Analysis}
Probability and Severity are rated on 1-10 scales, with 10 being the most probable/severe.

\item[SR\refstepcounter{srnum}\thesrnum\label{SR4}:] Product shall be made from anti-corrosive materials. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Existing Requirements}

The following requirements have already been included in the SRS document, and are restated here for convenience: \\

 \noindent FR9: Lock must only be engaged/disengaged by the intended user(s). \newline 
 FR10: The lock can be mounted to the bike's frame. \newline
 NFR6: The lock must be waterproofed to withstand normal rainfall. \\
 NFR7: The lock must be waterproofed to withstand normal splashing while riding. \\
 NFR13: Battery must last for greater than 1 month and/or 60 rides before needing to be replaced or charged. \\
 NFR14: Batteries must be accessible to replace or chargeable. \\


\section{Roadmap}
The safety requirements that will be implemented in the scope of Mechatronics Capstone 4TB6 are SR1 and SR3. They are vital to the functionality, safety and security of the SmartLock and are reasonably achievable given the constraints of the course, project and Team. The implementation of SR2 and SR4 will be postponed until after the course has been completed due to financial, temporal and accessibility reasons.
