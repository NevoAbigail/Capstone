\section{Purpose}
The purpose of this documentation is to break down the components that will come together to create the final product, as well as how they interact and why they are used. This document will show everything that the SmartLock is made from and when it will be assembled in order to provide transparency throughout the entire design project.

\section{Scope}

\wss{Include a figure that show the System Context (showing the boundary between
your system and the environment around it.)}

\subsection{Connection Between Requirements and Design} \label{SecConnection}

\wss{The intention of this section is to document decisions that are made
  ``between'' the requirements and the design.  To satisfy some requirements,
  design decisions need to be made.  Rather than make these decisions implicit,
  they are explicitly recorded here.  For instance, if a program has security
  requirements, a specific design decision may be made to satisfy those
  requirements with a password.}

\section{User Interfaces}
There are two user interfaces related to our product. The first is through an application (SmartLock) and the second is the lock itself where the user will be required to manually open/close the chain to secure the bike. \\


The application is where the user will be able to disengage their lock and locate where it was left with the Geotagging feature. \\

 \end{center}
 \end{figure}

\newpage
The hardware will be mounted to the bike, which will require user interaction upon the purchase of the SmartLock. Additionally, the user must push the locking pin into the hole to engage the lock, and disengage the lock with their phone to be able to remove the pin.

\section{Design of Hardware}

The following is a list of the hardware components that will be acquired to build the SmartLock:
\begin{itemize}
\item Arduino
\item Locking Cable
\item Bike Attachment
\end{itemize}

The following is a list of the hardware components that will be built for the SmartLock:
\begin{itemize}
\item Circuit (discussed below)
\item Lock Housing (CAD)
\item Locking Mechanism (CAD)
\end{itemize}

%\wss{Show what will be built, with detail on fabrication and materials}
%\wss{Include appendices as appropriate, possibly with sketches, drawings, CAD, etc}

\section{Design of Electrical Components}

The following is a list of the electrical components that will be used in combination with the aforementioned Arduino to make up the circuitry used to control the SmartLock:
\begin{itemize}
\item Battery
\subitem - Needs to be acquired
\item Transistor
\subitem - Previously owned
\item Wiring

\section{Design of Communication Protocols}

In order for the SmartLock to work there are signals that have to be used to communicate between the application and the physical lock. 
The features of our lock include: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Locking the bike from the application
\subitem - A Bluetooth microcontroller is utilized so that the application is able to communicate with the physical device
\subitem - The microcontroller is wired directly to an electromagnet that controls the disengagement of the lock
\item Geotagging the location of the bike
\subitem - Integration with Google Maps will be used to save the coordinates of the locked bike
\end{itemize}
%\wss{If appropriate}

\subsection{Communication Protocols}
%Communication protocols are if you are broadcasting or receiving messages.  If your project doesn't do this, then you don't need to worry about this section.

\subsection{Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Problem Analysis and Design.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What are the limitations of your solution?  Put another way, given
  unlimited resources, what could you do to make the project better? (LO\_ProbSolutions)
  
  Given unlimited resources our bike lock would function without any human exertion, ie. mechanics, specifically, motors would work to open and close the lock eliminating the need for the user to touch the lock at all. They would simply have to touch a button on their phone. Additionally, there would be separate components to ensure the locking of the wheels to the frame and the frame to an external secure location.  Finally, with unlimited resources, there would be a way to ensure the seat of the bike could not be removed either.
  
  \item Give a brief overview of other design solutions you considered.  What
  are the benefits and tradeoffs of those other designs compared with the chosen
  design?  From all the potential options, why did you select documented design?
  (LO\_Explores)
  
  All of our solutions were fairly similar given that there are only so many different ways to lock a bike. The main differences came from various housing alternatives and "chain" variations. Our original idea functioned more similarly to the ideal situation described above, but in scaling our project to be realistic we had to eliminate and restructure our ideas.  
  
  Some of our other ideas were: 
  \begin{itemize}
\item A foldable chain that could be folded up small and compressed to the bike while riding

\end{itemize}
  
\end{enumerate}
