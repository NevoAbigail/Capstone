  ProtoStax Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense RGB Peripheral
  This is a example sketch for controlling the RGB LED on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense with 
  Bluetooth over Python.  
  Items used:

  It publishes a Bluetooth LE Client profile with Characteristics for the Red, Green, and Blue 
  components of the onboard RGB LED
  The RGB LED can therefore be turned on/off over Bluetooth. There is an accompanying 
  Python script that toggles the R,G,B LEDs based on user input. Run the python program from 
  your computer (PC, Mac or Linux) that has Bluetooth support and the 
  requisite python packages -- you can then read and set the on/off states of the 3 colors. 
  
  The Red, Green and Blue colors of the onboard RGB LED can only be turned on or off. 
  It is not possible to use PWM to mix colors, unfortunately, based on how the 
  Arduino Nano BLE Sense board is configured. 
  We write a value of 1 to turn on a color and 0 to turn it off. The user inputs 
  a string that can contain r,g,b (or any combination) and those colors will be toggled.
  The Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense is chockful of other sensors - you can similarly expose 
  those sensors data as Characteristics
